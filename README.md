Notes

1. share cheatsheets at end of day 1 : https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/
2. reorder day 1, so that we do: one ctd-only cruise, two ctd-only cruises, then merging?
3. How are we setting up each lesson? scripts, notebooks, working directories, projects?
4. combined csv - some random named columns, stations are characters not numeric
